# Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have.

0. Multiple mains - Create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
1. Like, comment, subscribe - Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. 0>972 - Fix the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
